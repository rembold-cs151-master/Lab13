# Lab 13: The Search for the Snake

Today you'll be writing a function to find and count the number of instances of the word "python" within the provided file `Search.txt`. Make sure you:
* Output the found row and column locations in a new file: `Found.txt`
* Return the counted number of found words
* Upload not only your `Lab13.py` but also your generated `Found.txt` file!

I should be able to get some auto-tests going for this, so you will get the green checkmark if all is well!
